      <h3>Some Examples</h3>
      <p><i>Click the blue "This Gist" link at the bottom left of each example to see the source code on my Github account.</i>
      <br><br>First, just create a short list and print it out. Make sure your code looks exactly like mine! You can do this in the interactive shell.
      After the last print statement, you'll have to press enter twice to end the for loop.
      </p>

      <p>Lists store items in order, and you can look up any item in the list according to its position, or "index". Lists can be sliced, just like strings.
      </p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/lists.py?slice=17:20"></script>
      <pre>Try slicing my_list so that python displays [2,3,5]. They try [13,21] two ways.</pre>
      
      <p>It's fine to mix different types in the same list, if that's what you want! Python is a relaxed language.
      </p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/lists.py?slice=24:27"></script>
      
      <p>Now let's take a look at Python's built-in method "range". This is one of my favorite list shortcuts.
      In Python 2.7, using the "range" method will return a list of all the integers between 0 and 1 less than the parameter.
      In this small example, "range" gives us access to [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. There are 4 elements total, from 0 to 4.
      </p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/lists.py?slice=48:52"></script>
      <p>What do you think these lists will contain? Print them out and see!</p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/lists.py?slice=52:55"></script>
      Lists are mutable, which means that we often update them by adding and taking off items.
      <h3>Commands for updating lists</h3>
      <pre>
      append - adds item to the end of a list
      del - deletes an item based on it's index
      remove - deletes an item named by item
      pop - deletes the last item or an item by index, can be printed or assigned
      insert - inserts an item at index that you choose
      </pre>
      We also can replace an item in a list by simply using assignment(=) along with the index. Try these examples in the shell.
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/lists.py?slice=71:80"></script>
  
      <p>Copying a list isn't as simple as you might think. Try to guess what this code will print before you run it.</p>
      <script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/https://github.com/wendyjan/learn_python/tree/master/gdi_buffalo_2015/class1/lists.py?slice=57:70"></script>
      
      
      <p>Finally, try using Google to find more useful methods for lists. That's all for now!</p>
